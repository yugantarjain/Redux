# Redux
### Redux project, to make this world a better place to live than what it is right now.  
Built purely on Swift to give a completely native user experience along with robust performance.  
Redux at this stage features a platform to allow people to share things with other users nearby and hence make the concept of 'Buy less, share more' possible.
